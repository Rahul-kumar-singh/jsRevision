The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is 
immutableâ€”just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. For instance, in the case where the content
 is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its properties) can be altered.


 An initializer for a constant is required. You must specify its value in the same statement in which it's
  declared. (This makes sense, given that it can't be changed later.)

  This declaration creates a constant whose scope can be either global or local to the block in which it
   is declared. Global constants do not become properties of the window object, unlike var variables.
