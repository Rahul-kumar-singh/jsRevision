Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword.
The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator),
 and it can't be redeclared (i.e. through a variable declaration).
 However, if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed.

 A constant cannot share its name with a function or a variable in the same scope.
