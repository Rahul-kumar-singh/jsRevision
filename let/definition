The let statement declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement,
 or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which declares a variable globally, 
or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.
Just like const the let does not create properties of the window object when declared globally 
(in the top-most scope).

Many issues with let variables can be avoided by declaring them at the top of the scope in which they are used
 (doing so may impact readibility).
