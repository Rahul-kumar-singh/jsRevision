Rest syntax looks exactly like spread syntax. In a way, rest syntax is the opposite of spread syntax. 
Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and
 "condenses" them into a single element.

 Rest operator is used to merge a list of function arguments into an array.
