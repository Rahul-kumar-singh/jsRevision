An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but is limited
 and can't be used in all situations.
 Does not have its own bindings to this or super, and should not be used as methods.
 Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:
 let myFunction = (a, b) => a * b;
 An arrow function makes an implicit return; in this case, the return keyword will be optional.
 rest and destructing parameters can be implemented using an arrow function.
They both need parentheses.
Arrow function can never be a constructor
